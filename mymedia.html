            I shared an interesting fact about my favorite book. Did you know that the 
            book "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen was written in various sections and took about 
            three weeks to complete. It's a masterpiece with its unique structure.

            "Bahubali" directed by Rajamouli. The mind-bending plot, stunning visuals and
            prabhas's iconic score make it a cinematic experience like no other. The exploration 
            of dreams within dreams and the concept of reality is truly fascinating.
